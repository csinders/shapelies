processing game for toddlers, teaching them how to draw with shapes


my ICM (introduction to computational media) final for fall/winter 2012 at ITP.

it's a game designed for toddlers to teach them how to draw, build, and see the world through basic shapes. 

the child grabs a shape and it snapes into place to form a larger picture- which is a house.
